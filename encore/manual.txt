Okay, so let's keep this as a simple README.txt-esue thing.

There are exacty 12 playable buses in the game. (Some of which ARENT buses...)

These include buses from the original CrazyBus and are:

		the irizar century 3.95,
		the busscar vissta buss,
		the generic school-bus,
		the busscar jum buss 360,
		the encava e-nt6000,
		the marcopolo paradiso gv1150,
		the pico-8 logo,
		loge,
		impostor loge,
		totally not a hotweels m&m-themed bus I found on google for a joke,
		hero wentward dt40l from BeamNG,
		sleipnir glacier bus from iceland

Some of these buses (but not all) have special features about them.
You can find those out for yourself.

This game DOES in fact have the iconic music from the original CrazyBus.

Finally, there is a small corruptor mode I included from a snippet.
Access it by holding UP and LEFT on whatever control method you use while the PICO-8 splash is on screen.
It really only corrupts the titlescreen and all the sounds and sprites, it doesn't actively corrupt the game lol.

That's about it, have fun toying around with my little COVID-19 stir-craziness project.
